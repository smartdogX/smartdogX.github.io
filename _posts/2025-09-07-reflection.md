It has been two weeks since this semester began. In general, I feel that I have been doing well.

I usually got up at 8a.m., attended the first class every morning, and always had one class at noon. I regularly went to the CAMP seminar and the colloquium. I also had TA duties on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. When I had time, I would go down to the subbasement and follow the progress of the experiment. I have a good relationship with everyone, and life feels stable and regular.

Recently, because of my courses, I started to review some basic theory. It felt magic to review these concepts. I hope to improve understanding about theory after review. Actually, the tight schedule made me feel a little tired, so I am also preparing for the exemption. 

Anyway, I am happy with how things are going. I will work harder and stay positive, I believe everything will turn out great.
