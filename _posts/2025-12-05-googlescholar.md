I had [my first published paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.nanolett.5c04854) the day before yesterday! 

Although I just made some minor contribution in the project, I am still very happy and I see that as a fresh start. Keep trying, I believe that I can achieve greater goals in the future!

I also have create a [Google scholar homepage](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=list_works&gmla=AElLoL0HU6UFhELGmNjZiE8h5PDubj4FH2xIR3V6B91k9R-VLLCvZk5fyYAMML_o-1_dofpnCvhG_qd8IfZVUw&user=tS8aCiAAAAAJ) and added it to the sidebar.
