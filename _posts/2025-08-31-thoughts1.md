有些时候我的悲伤就像无由来的水一样，不知何时就汩汩流出。
开学也已经一周了，之前暑假的毕业旅行的游记也没有写完。生活中我常常为一些小事悲伤，一直累积着，到一个零界点就喷薄而出了。
每每我想到关于未来和命运的一些事，于是陷入一种对巨大的不确定性的迷茫之中，而生活庸庸碌碌，一如往常，我就会陷入一种抽离的状态。就像在渐渐进入秋天凉凉的晚风中，想到故乡的佳肴。
一切都是激素的作用。
还得向前。

Sometimes my sadness just comes out of nowhere, like water which comes from nothing.
It's about one week since the new semester began, I haven't finished the journal about my trip in summer. I just can't help feeling sad about some little things, the sadness keep growing, at some point, 
it just breaks out.
Everytime I think about future and fate, I am trapped in a directionless mood, but life keeps going as past, never changes. I can't stop thinking about the delicious food from my homecountry, in the cold autumn wind.
All of above is because of hormone.
Life keeps going.
