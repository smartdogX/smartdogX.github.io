# Use the QE(Quantum Espresso) on WSL
After few days of hard work, I finally have successfully download and set the Quantum Espresso on my windows computer using WSL(Windows subsystem for Windows). So this is a record of the setting process.
## Set the WSL
Reference: [Install WSL | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). 
Basically, just type the following code in PowerShell and windows will do the rest things for you.
```
wsl --install
```
It's relatively easy, and there is nothing difficult.
## Cooperate with VScode(Optional)
Reference: [Get started using VS Code with WSL | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-vscode)
If you want to use your VScode as the editor when using WSL, you can connnect them. 
The only tricky step is to connect from VScode, sometimes it will encounter some errors. Try connecting from the WSL in this situation, type the following code in the WSL terminal
```
code .
```
## Download the QE
Reference: [User's Guide for Quantum-ESPRESSO](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/Doc/user_guide/)
This can be tricky if you are not familar with Linux like me few days ago. 
There are two ways to download the QE: 
### Download from the offical website
First, install build dependencies
```
# Step 1: Install dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
  build-essential \
  gfortran \
  mpifort \
  libfftw3-dev \
  libblas-dev \
  liblapack-dev \
  libscalapack-mpi-dev \
  make
```
Then Type the following code in the WSL terminal
```
# Step 2: get the package from the offcial website
wget "offical webiste"
(for example:wget https://www.quantum-espresso.org/rdm-download/488/v7-4-1/7ea7262b594ab757b2c13aaad1214c27/qe-7.4.1-ReleasePack.tar.gz)
```
Now you have got the package of the QE, then extract the source code by
```
# step 3: extrcat the source
tar -xvf 'name of the package'
(for example: qe-7.4.1-ReleasePack.tar.gz)
cd 'The folder name'
(for example: qe-7.4.1-ReleasePack.tar.gz)
```
Then configure the code
```
# step 4: configure
./configure
```
Then build the code
```
# step 5: make all
make all
```
Finally, you have completed the installation.
You can test the installation by
```
# Step 6: Test installation
./bin/pw.x -v
```
These are some mystorious Linux code and you can always ask ChatGPT if you don't understand them.
### Download via git
The procedure is nearly the same. 

```
# Step 1: Install dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
  build-essential \
  gfortran \
  mpifort \
  libfftw3-dev \
  libblas-dev \
  liblapack-dev \
  libscalapack-mpi-dev \
  git \
  wget \
  make

# Step 2: Clone Quantum ESPRESSO source code
git clone https://github.com/QEF/q-e.git
cd q-e

# Optional: Check out a stable release (e.g., 7.2)
git checkout qe-7.2

# Step 3: Configure
./configure

# Step 4: Build all modules (can take several minutes)
make all

# Step 5: Test installation
pw.x -v
```
### Add executables to PATH
Refernce: [How do I add an executable to my search path? - Ask Ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/questions/322772/how-do-i-add-an-executable-to-my-search-path)
You can add executables to PATH so you can call these program conveniently by 
```
(Optional) Add executables to PATH
echo 'export PATH="$PWD/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
## Run some tests
The QE already contains some test suites in the program. You can check [Test suite and test farm · Wiki · QEF - Quantum ESPRESSO Foundation / q-e · GitLab](https://gitlab.com/QEF/q-e/-/wikis/Developers/Test-suite-and-test-farm).
If you cannot run them properly, you can use the examples provided by [yyyu200/DFTbook: An introduction to DFT.](https://github.com/yyyu200/DFTbook/tree/master) to try again.
